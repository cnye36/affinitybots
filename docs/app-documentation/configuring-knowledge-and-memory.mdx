# Configuring Knowledge and Long-Term Memory

Long-term memory allows your agent to remember past interactions and learn from them, providing a more personalized and consistent experience.

## How Long-Term Memory Works

By default, **Long-Term Memory is enabled** for all new agents. This means the agent will automatically store relevant information from your conversations and recall it when needed.

## Managing Memories

You have full control over what your agent remembers.

1.  Open the **Agent Configuration** modal.
2.  Navigate to the **"Memory"** tab.
3.  Here you can view a list of all stored memories.
4.  You can **edit** or **delete** specific memories if they are incorrect or no longer relevant.

## Adding Knowledge

Besides learning from conversations, you can explicitly provide knowledge to your agent.

- **Upload Documents**: You can upload PDF, TXT, or MD files to the agent's knowledge base.
- **Add Text Snippets**: You can directly paste important information that the agent should always know.

## Best Practices

- **Review Regularly**: Periodically check your agent's memory to ensure it's retaining accurate information.
- **Prune Irrelevant Data**: Delete memories that are no longer useful to keep the agent focused.
- **Be Explicit**: When adding knowledge, ensure it is clear and unambiguous.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sensitive information should be handled with care. While memories are private to your agent, avoid storing highly sensitive personal data unless necessary.
