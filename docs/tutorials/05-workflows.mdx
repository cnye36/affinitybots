# Designing Automated Workflows

Workflows orchestrate agents, triggers, and tasks into repeatable automations. This tutorial explains how to review existing workflows, build new graphs, and execute or maintain them over time.

## Exploring Saved Workflows

- Visit `/workflows` to see the workflows you own. Cards show the workflow name, last run time, node count, and avatars for assigned agents.
- Hovering reveals a delete buttonâ€”use it carefully because removal is permanent and cancels all downstream automations.
- The page includes an empty state prompting you to create your first workflow, complete with a call-to-action button.

## Creating or Editing a Workflow

1. Click **Create New Workflow** (or open an existing workflow) to load the visual builder.
2. The canvas uses React Flow, so you can drag nodes around freely. Pan and zoom to organize large graphs.
3. Use the header to rename the workflow, switch between Editor and Executions modes, and trigger manual runs.
4. Add nodes via the Task Sidebar or the mobile-friendly Task Selection Sheet. Nodes represent triggers, agent tasks, or tool actions.
5. Connect nodes by dragging edges between handles to define execution order.
6. Autosave keeps drafts up to date; the builder compares snapshots so redundant writes are avoided.

## Assigning Agents and Configuring Tasks

- Each task can be assigned to an agent via the **Assign Agent** action. A modal lists all available agents with avatars so you can pick the right teammate.
- Task configuration panels let you customize inputs, outputs, and other settings depending on the task type.
- Triggers can be added once a workflow is saved. Configure them to start the workflow on schedules, webhooks, or other events.

## Executing a Workflow

- Click **Run Workflow** from the header to execute manually.
- The execution manager coordinates status updates and surfaces success or failure notifications via toast messages.
- Switch to the **Executions** tab to review past runs once telemetry is persisted.

## Mobile Builder Experience

- The builder detects smaller screens and switches to a guided wizard (WorkflowMobileWizard) that steps through node creation without requiring drag-and-drop.
- Tasks can still be assigned agents and configured through this wizard, making on-the-go edits possible.

## Maintenance Tips

- Revisit workflows periodically to ensure node configurations still align with business rules, especially after updating agent prompts or tools.
- Use descriptive names for tasks and workflows so team members understand each automation at a glance.
- Clean up unused workflows to keep the dashboard metrics accurate and reduce clutter in the activity feed.
