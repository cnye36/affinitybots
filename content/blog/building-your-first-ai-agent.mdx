Creating your first AI agent might seem daunting, but with the right tools and approach, you can have a fully functional agent up and running in just a few minutes. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process using AffinityBots. If you want a preview of what mature automation looks like, skim [AI-First Workflows](/blog/ai-first-workflows-how-to-build-smarter-faster-more-scalable-operations) for the end-to-end blueprint we’re steering toward.

> **Goal:** By the time you reach the bottom of this post you’ll have launched a working agent, uploaded supporting knowledge, added tools, and shared it with your team.
## What You’ll Need

- An AffinityBots account (a free workspace works perfectly)
- Clarity on the “job to be done” for your first agent—support triage, demo requests, lead capture, anything repeatable
- A couple of reference docs (pricing, FAQs, or onboarding checklists) to use as optional knowledge

## Step 1 · Open the Agent Builder

From the AffinityBots dashboard click **Create Agent**. You’ll land on the dedicated builder screen where every control lives in one scrollable panel.

 className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-8"
 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 70vw"
/>


## Step 2 · Give Your Agent a Name (Optional but Fun)

Right at the top you’ll see the **Name (Optional)** card. Drop in something memorable like “LaunchPad Liaison” or leave it blank and AffinityBots will generate a creative label for you.

<Image

  alt="Name your agent"
  width={1200}
  height={720}
  className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-8"
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 70vw"
/>

<Callout type="info" title="Why the name matters">
Names show up in the agent list, chat headers, and team notifications. Pick something that signals the agent’s job so teammates know what to expect.
</Callout>

## Step 3 · Explain what you need your agent to do:

The heart of the builder is the **Describe Your AI Agent** textarea. Think of it as a conversation with a teammate: set the mission, rules, and desired outputs. The UI includes a built-in **Enhance** button that tightens your instructions if you want a quick upgrade.

**Example brief**

```
I need an agent that can be the first responder for inbound product demos.
- Greet leads by name when available.
- Capture company, role, and current tooling.
- Answer pricing questions using the attached FAQ.
- Escalate enterprise leads to the human sales team.
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Use the Enhance button">
Enter your draft, click **Enhance**, and AffinityBots will polish the instructions while keeping your intent intact. It's a great way to get professional-quality prompts without being a prompt expert.
</Callout>

## Step 4 · Jump-Start with a Template

Directly below the description box, you'll see a list of templates. Click any template to prefill the description box with a curated system prompt. You can treat it as a starting point or use it verbatim.

<Image

 alt="Agent templates displayed as pills"
 width={1200}
 height={540}
 className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-8"
 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 70vw"
/>

Templates are especially handy when you’re onboarding go-to-market or support teammates—one click, tweak a sentence, ship it.

## Step 5 · Wire Up the Right Tools

Next up is the **Add Tools** accordion. Use the dropdown to toggle any integrations you need—Gmail, Notion, Supabase, HubSpot, whatever is enabled in your workspace.

<image
  src="/docs-images/Tools-selection.png"
  alt="Add tools"
  width={1200}
  height={540}
  className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-8"
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 70vw"
/>

Tips:

- Grant tools on a need-to-use basis so each agent stays focused.
- You can add or remove tools later without recreating the agent.
- All selections show up as a badge count on the accordion header so you never lose track.

If you’re not sure which tools to start with, skim [Harnessing Agentic AI for Business](/blog/harnessing-agentic-ai-for-business-multi-agent-systems-and-workflow-automation) for role-based recommendations.

## Step 6 · Load Supporting Knowledge

Click **Add Knowledge** to open the drag-and-drop zone. AffinityBots queues your docs locally and uploads them after the agent is created, updating the progress in real time.

<Image

 alt="Add knowledge"
 width={1200}
 height={540}
 className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-8"
 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 70vw"
/>

- Drag files straight onto the dropzone or click to browse
- Supported types include PDF, DOCX, CSV, XLSX, Markdown, HTML, and more
- After creation the builder automatically writes successful uploads to the agent’s knowledge base

<Callout type="success" title="Short on docs?">
Start with a single FAQ or pricing sheet. You can always drop in more files later from the agent settings page.
</Callout>

## Step 7 · Launch the Agent

With description, tools, and knowledge squared away, hit **Create Agent**. The system will:

1. Process your agent configuration and create the new agent
2. Upload any knowledge files you selected and show progress badges (queued → uploading → success/error)
3. Connect your knowledge files to the agent's memory
4. Take you to your new agent's workspace

<Image
 src="/docs-images/Creating-agent-dialog.png"
 alt="Agent creation dialog showing progress"
 width={600}
 height={320}
 className="w-96 h-auto rounded-lg mb-8 mx-auto"
 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 70vw"
/>

If anything fails mid-upload you’ll see an inline error badge with retry guidance—no guessing which file stalled.

## Step 8 · Share It with Your Team

Once created, the agent shows up in your workspace list. From there you can:

- Send the share link to teammates so they can start chatting immediately
- Duplicate the agent when you want a variant for another segment
- Open the edit drawer to add more tools, adjust instructions, or re-order knowledge

Remember: agents are iterative. Early feedback helps you tighten prompts, add missing FAQs, or relax escalation rules.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to build everything from scratch?**

No. Templates give you a tuned starting point, and the Enhance button polishes whatever you type.

**Can I upload knowledge later?**

Yep. Head back to the agent detail page, drop in more files, and the system will index them in the background.

**What if I want humans in the loop?**

Add clear escalation instructions in your description (“If revenue > $10K, summarize the conversation and route to Sales Ops”). AffinityBots will follow them to the letter.

## Keep Building

You just launched your first agent without leaving the browser. Next, try chaining a few together using the multi-agent workflow patterns in [AI-First Workflows](/blog/ai-first-workflows-how-to-build-smarter-faster-more-scalable-operations) or give your new teammate superpowers with the retrieval strategies in [Combining RAG and Reasoning](/blog/combining-rag-with-reasoning-in-ai).
